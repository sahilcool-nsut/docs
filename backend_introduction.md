# Backend
## Introduction
The entire backend is developed in Python, using libraries like **Flask, Pandas, Numpy** etc.
There are two main files being used:
1) app.py - This is basically the server file, in which route handling has been done, and specific function calls are made.
2) Recommender.py - This contains the Recommender class, which is helping us fetch data from datasets and is doing the actual computation for recommendations. 

Apart from that, we have used datasets named products.csv, orderHistory.csv, browseHistory.csv and correlationData.csv. 

These have been discussed in detail in the upcoming sections.

The repository of the backend system can be found here: https://github.com/namansingh73/smartBag
